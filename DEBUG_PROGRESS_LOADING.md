# PROGRESS LOADING DEBUG PLAN

## Issue: Progress is saved to Firebase but not loaded when user logs back in

## Step-by-Step Testing Process

### Step 1: Verify Current Setup

1. ✅ Backend running on http://localhost:5000
2. ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
3. ✅ Firebase config with environment variables
4. ✅ FirebaseService implemented
5. ✅ UserContext has progress loading logic

### Step 2: Test Firebase Connectivity

**In Browser Console:**

```javascript
// Test Firebase connection
testFirebaseConnection();

// Debug current progress loading
debugProgressLoading();
```

### Step 3: Manual Test Flow

1. **Open browser to http://localhost:5173**
2. **Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab**
3. **Register new account or login to existing**
4. **Look for these console messages:**
   - "🔄 Starting progress initialization for user: [userID]"
   - "📊 Retrieved progress from Firebase: [array]"
   - "✅ Progress loaded into state successfully"

### Step 4: Play Game & Save Progress

1. **Play any game mode (Standard/Email/Social/URL)**
2. **Complete at least one level**
3. **Look for console message:**
   - "Saving game progress to Firebase:"
   - "Game progress saved successfully"

### Step 5: Test Progress Persistence

1. **Logout from the game**
2. **Login again**
3. **Check console for loading messages**
4. **Go to Dashboard and verify progress shows**

### Step 6: Direct Firebase Testing

**In Browser Console:**

```javascript
// Test with actual user ID (replace 'USER_ID' with real ID from console)
testFirebase("USER_ID");

// Test current user's progress
testCurrentUserProgress();
```

### Step 7: Firebase Console Verification

1. **Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/**
2. **Select project: scambusters-d5ce4**
3. **Navigate to Firestore Database**
4. **Check for collection: gameProgress**
5. **Verify documents exist with format: userID_gameMode**

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Firestore Security Rules

**Problem:** Rules might block reads
**Solution:** Ensure rules allow authenticated users to read their data

### Issue 2: Composite Index Missing

**Problem:** Query with orderBy fails
**Solution:** ✅ Added fallback query without orderBy

### Issue 3: Timing Issue

**Problem:** Progress loading happens before user is set
**Solution:** ✅ Progress loading is in auth state listener after user is set

### Issue 4: State Not Updating

**Problem:** LOAD_PROGRESS action not working
**Solution:** ✅ Added debugging to reducer

### Issue 5: localStorage Interference

**Problem:** localStorage overriding Firebase data
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed localStorage to only save auth state

## Quick Fix Commands

If issues are found, run these in browser console:

// Clear localStorage and test fresh
localStorage.clear();

// Test Firebase directly
testFirebaseConnection();

// Debug current state
debugProgressLoading();

// Check Firebase Console
checkFirebaseConsole();
```
